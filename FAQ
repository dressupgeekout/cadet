== CADET FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ==

Q. What's so special about bozohttpd?

A. Nothing. That's the point.

Q. What does "Cadet" mean?

A. You could probably find a space cadet on the moon. A space cadet is also
a bit of a bozo.

Q. Aren't there already Lua web interface things? Ever heard of the Kepler
project?

A. Yes, I've seen them, but none of them were built with bozohttpd in mind.
Cadet's code base can be kept remarkably small because it bozohttpd depends
on inetd(8) -- specifically, we read and write HTTP messages from the
standard input and output. Those are the only file descriptors that really
matter. Cadet can make these assumptions; other web frameworks cannot.

Furthermore, Cadet has an explicit goal of not requiring LuaRocks.
