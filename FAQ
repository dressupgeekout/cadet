== CADET FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ==

[Q] What's so special about bozohttpd?

[A] Nothing, really. That's the point.

-----

[Q] What does "Cadet" mean?

[A] You could probably find a space cadet on the moon. A space cadet is also
a bit of a bozo.

-----

[Q] Aren't there already Lua web interface things? Ever heard of the Kepler
project?

[A] Yes, I've seen them, but none of them were built with bozohttpd in mind.
Cadet's code base can be kept remarkably small because it bozohttpd depends
on inetd(8) -- specifically, we read and write HTTP messages from the
standard input and output. Those are the only file descriptors that really
matter. Cadet can make these assumptions; other web frameworks cannot.

Furthermore, Cadet has an explicit goal of not requiring LuaRocks.
